# tinyimage

This is a CLI tool that allows you to compress an image on macOS's clipboard using TinyPNG's API.
I use it personally when making screenshots to put into a Jekyll based static site.

## Requirements

* Currently only macOS is supported (pull requests accepted!)
* To access image data on the clipboard, [pngpaste](https://github.com/jcsalterego/pngpaste) is used. You can install it via [homebrew](https://brew.sh).
* An API key from TinyPNG. Get yours for free from here: [tinypng.com/developers](https://tinypng.com/developers)

## Installation

The easiest way to install it is with RubyGems via the normal install method `gem install tinyimage`.

## Usage

Just type `tinyimage` at a prompt and follow the instructions provided.
